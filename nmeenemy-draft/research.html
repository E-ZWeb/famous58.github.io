        <button class="accordion">Introducing the anti-vaccine movement and the current state of vaccine coverage in the united states and the rest of the world. </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Over the past few years, vaccine rates have dropped in many US states and at the same time, some diseases thought to have been eradicated, such as whooping cough and the measles have seen comeback outbreaks (Matthews 1). The World Health Organization says in their vaccine fact sheet that global vaccine coverage is at 85% and hasn’t improved in several years (WHO 1). Based on this information we haven’t yet reached the global quota of vaccine coverage to maintain herd immunity. Herd immunity is the threshold of vaccine coverage needed to be maintained in order to keep disease from spreading particularly through vulnerable people such as infants, the elderly, people with diseases that disallow them from vaccinating, as well as people with very weak immune systems. When people stop vaccinating it brings down the vaccine coverage and creates weak spots where disease can take hold and spread. Many efforts are being made by several organizations including the WHO to reach a vaccine coverage goal by 2020 (WHO 1) and one of the difficulties standing in the way is a wave of misinformation that has given rise to a movement of people who deliberately choose not to vaccinate, collectively called the anti-vaccine movement or “anti-vaxxers”. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Introducing the information we have on NMEs and what they are and how they work. </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The information available about anti-vaccination is rather limited. Most of what we have is NME (non-medical exemption) rates. These NME rates are also only limited to countries and states that allow NMEs. Other data includes interviews and psychological analysis based on previous knowledge of human behavior. This paper will review various sources of data related to anti-vaccination, the psychology behind anti-vaccination, global vaccine coverage, and correlations found between NME rates and disease outbreaks. 
  
NME stands for Non-Medical Exemption, and as the name suggests, it is an exemption form a parent can fill out to be excused from vaccination for non-medical reasons. Not all regions allow NMEs and different US states may have specific laws related to vaccine exemptions. As of 2017, 3 states have fully disallowed NMEs while the others allow either only religious exemption or both religious and philosophical exemption (see Figure 1). In regard to the difference between religious and philosophical exemption, the National Conference of State Legislatures says:</p> <blockquote class="card-text blockquote text-center">

“Religious exemption indicates that there is a provision in the statute that allows parents to exempt their children from vaccination if it contradicts their sincere religious beliefs. 

 

Philosophical exemption indicates that the statutory language does not restrict the exemption to purely religious or spiritual beliefs.  For example, Maine allows restrictions based on "moral, philosophical or other personal beliefs," and Minnesota allows objections based on “conscientiously held beliefs of the parent or guardian.”” (NCSL 1) </blockquote>

    <p>So, the primary difference between religious and philosophical exemption is the language used in your reasons for the exemption. Do note that exemption for medical reasons is a completely different story. In some cases, such as a pregnancy, one can be exempt from vaccination. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Current state of NME policy and how NME rates have changed over the years.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>NME rates have risen in many of the US states that allow them over the years. According to a journal published by PLOS medicine, the number of NMEs in kindergartners has increased dramatically between 2009 and 2014 in 12 of the states that allow philosophical vaccine exemption and has continued to climb to this day (see Figure 2) (Olive JK et al. 1). A report by the American Academy of Family Physicians claims that the state of Idaho, a state which allows NMEs had the most NMEs. During the evaluation, Idaho had approved 147 religious exemptions and 1295 philosophical exemptions. The academy also claims, “There are 11 states (AK, AZ, CO, ID, ME, MI, OR, UT, VT, WA, and WI) that reported 4% of its kindergarteners claimed exemptions.” (AAFP 1). The focus of many of these studies is infants and young children likely because they are the most vulnerable to contracting vaccine-preventable illnesses. </p>

    <button class="accordion">The psychology and mechanics behind anti-vaccination. </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>There are many known reasons and conspiracies which drive some people to not vaccinate. Oftentimes it comes from misinformation in media reporting and cognitive bias based on personal experience. This section will cover some commonly believed myths about vaccines, some celebrities and media mechanics involved in spreading misinformation as well as the psychology behind anti-vaccination based on our previous knowledge of human behavior. </p>  <p>The CDC and the WHO provide a detailed list of common reasons for anti-vaccination. Each listing the common reasons then elaborating and explaining each one. Of the reasons mentioned in the CDC’s list and discussed in the WHO’s list we have issues such as the belief that the real impact on disease is caused by better hygiene through improved socioeconomic conditions, supposedly dangerous additives used in vaccines, the belief that vaccines are linked to autism as well as some other diseases, the idea that taking too many vaccines can weaken our ability to form natural immunity to disease, the paradoxical statistics which show that the majority of people who get disease are vaccinated, and lastly the belief that because a certain disease has been eradicated from a region that you don’t need to vaccinate for that disease if you live in said region. Given the sheer number of things listed in just a summary of a list, there are many reasons why some parents might follow the anti-vaccine movement. This paper will discuss some psychology and cognitive biases believed to be responsible for why people may ignore the overwhelming scientific data which clears up these ideas and myths.</p>  <p>Before this article plunges into the psychology behind anti-vaccination, it's important to discuss what cognitive biases are. Hank Green from Scishow explains:</p>
 <blockquote class="card-text blockquote text-center">
     “A cognitive bias is really just anything that skews how we process and interpret new information. There are tons of different kinds of bias. Some biases cause us to ignore certain data, some lead us to put too much emphasis on certain data. They can even drive us to focus on facts that are irrelevant to what we're observing. But essentially when we hear a hypothesis and think "Yeah, that 'Makes Sense'", really what we're saying is "Yeah, that fits with my cognitive biases"” (Hank Green 1:48-2:25) </blockquote> 

<p>, and the way cognitive bias affects our thinking and decision-making is thought to be the primary cause of anti-vaccination and how people will attribute it to diseases which have no known cause or are caused genetically.</p>  <p>It’s understood that the primary reasoning behind most anti-vaccination is cognitive bias and we know of several types of these biases that often work hand in hand. Scishow’s video, “The Science of Anti-Vaccination", gives us a rundown of what these biases are and how they work. Hank Green says cognitive biases are influenced by a person’s explanatory style. An explanatory style is the way in which a person tries to explain a certain event; some people will try to blame themselves, others may try to seek external reasons for something happening, and as Scishow puts it, “But one thing is clear, We are very bad at not blaming anything” (Hank Green), people are naturally more inclined to try to blame something. This means that when negativity bias comes into play, we tend to try to seek out an explanation for the things that go wrong rather than try to explain things that go right. In which case a parent might be quick to try to explain how vaccines are linked to their child’s autism. But there is plenty of peer-reviewed scientific information out there which shows clearly that there is no evidence for a link between vaccines and autism. So why do parents continue to believe this conspiracy? Well according to Scishow this is caused by confirmation bias which is the human tendency to seek out and openly accept data and information that confirms their beliefs.  </p>
 <p>Another bias which could affect a parent’s decision-making is omission bias, according to Hank Green. Omission bias is our preference to choose not to face the consequences of refraining from doing something over facing consequences of not doing anything at all. This means if a parent is faced with the choice of vaccinating they might be more inclined to choose not to if there are possible side effects, because it can be easier to handle the consequences if it can’t be blamed on your own actions, as once study cited in the video says “when the choice to vaccinate is framed as an action, the average parent will only vaccinate their child if not vaccinating is at least 2x more dangerous”(Hank Green 5:47-5:50). According to the video, omission bias can also be associated with naturalness bias because many parents prefer to allow their children’s immunity to form naturally rather than artificially from vaccines. One final note mentioned in the video which is strongly linked to why some parents don’t fairly weigh the risk of contracting a deadly disease over the risk of vaccine side effects is what psychologists call risk perception. According to Hank, humans are not very good at evaluating risks, particularly in a case where a parent is weighing a disease they have seen (autism) over a disease they haven’t seen in their lives (polio etc.) because vaccines have already eradicated diseases like polio. Paradoxically, the success of vaccines in eradicating diseases is partially responsible for people’s skepticism. In summary this video shows that the psychology behind vaccination is well understood and it is largely based on natural cognitive biases found in all human beings.</p>  <p>Cognitive bias alone isn’t completely responsible for vaccine skepticism; the media has played an important role in this as well. “Vaccines: An Unhealthy Skepticism Measles Virus Outbreak 2015”, a video published by the New York Times’ Retro Report highlights many of the events and mechanics behind how the media and celebrities have fueled the anti-vaccine movement by spreading misinformation and mistranslating scientific literature. This, according to the short documentary, is because there is a wide gap between the mainstream media and professional scientific literature (Zachary Green). Science doesn’t translate well into general English, and this can be seen happening in real time in a clip from an interview included in the video (Zachary Green). The guest scientist tells the interviewer “Based on what we know right now, we don’t think there is an association” (Zachary Green), then the interviewer responds with “but that’s not saying with 100 percent certainty there isn’t one” (Zachary Green). The interviewer largely misinterpreted the scientist explaining that the evidence shows that there is no link between vaccines and autism to there being a possibility of a link between vaccines and autism because what certainty and safety means from a scientific point of view is different from what an average person or a parent would consider it to be. To a parent, certainty and safety is either a yes or a no, to a scientist it is based on statistics and test results and usually relies on a percentage or based on current data. Seth Mnookin also says that mainstream reporters do a poor job of appropriately presenting the weight of evidence (Zachary Green). Sometimes a reporter will present an anecdotal from a single parent or celebrity with equal weight to the overall scientific consensus. In the case of Jenny McCarthy, a famous actress, model, and television host, many media outlets have given her a fair voice on vaccination despite McCarthy having no credibility in the field of public health or medicine.</p>  <p>Other studies suggest that anti-vaccination can be attributed to certain lifestyles, particularly natural lifestyles which avoid artificial solutions to problems. A study published by PLOSone called “Understanding the perceived logic of care by vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-refusing parents: a qualitative study in Australia”, conducts 29 “in-depth interviews” (Paul R. Ward et al.) with anti-vaccine parents in Australia. The parents discuss what influences their decision to avoid vaccination. A common topic the parents bring up in the interviews is something called salutogenic parenting. Salutogenic parenting, according to the study, is where parents practice health promoting activities which they believe boosts their child’s natural immunity. This is believed by the parents to lower or completely remove the need for vaccines. Some of these practices mentioned are breastfeeding and eating organic food. This shows that parents who don’t vaccinate try to compensate by doing other activities they deem superior to vaccines in strengthening immunity to disease. What we can take from this data is that anti-vaccination can be associated with a certain lifestyle. Parents who are accustomed to living a natural lifestyle may have a higher tendency to oppose vaccination because the opposition to vaccination plays well with their way of life.  </p> 
<p>It’s important to note, however, that the study published by PLOSone in no way whatsoever determines that these lifestyle choices, such as breastfeeding, are ineffective in strengthening immunity and protecting from disease. In fact, we have known for ages that most of these lifestyle choices do in fact benefit a child’s immunity as can be seen in this peer reviewed study published by ScienceDirect from 1998 which references decades worth of data and research, the first line of the results being “Human milk protects against infections in the breastfed offspring... There is also interesting evidence for an enhanced protection remaining for years after lactation”, meaning there are clear and mechanistic effects that breast milk has on immunity. Healthy choices and lifestyles are not a replacement to vaccines though. The effects of breastfeeding can’t be compared to the tremendous success of vaccination in eradicating disease worldwide. All this study shows is that people with a certain naturalness bias, as mentioned by Scishow’s video earlier, are more likely to oppose vaccination due to its artificial nature.</p>

     <button class="accordion">How NME rates and vaccine coverage differ by region (globally and in the United States)</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>In the United States, NME rates are exceptionally high in densely populated metropolitan counties. According to an article on Global Biodefense, NME rates seem to be concentrated in densely populated US counties and of the cities/counties mentioned are Seattle, WA, Phoenix, AZ, Houston, TX, Detroit, MI, and Salt Lake City, UT (Olive JK, et al. 1). This information is based on data gathered from the 18 US states that permit philosophical NMEs. It can be extrapolated from this data that big cities can be the most vulnerable due to the higher population of anti-vaccine parents bringing the vaccine coverage a lot lower.</p> <p>A large portion of infants who are not vaccinated are concentrated in 3rd world countries. Whereas a lack of vaccine confidence (how confident people are in the safety, effectiveness, or importance of vaccination) is highest in 1st world countries. According to the WHO’s Immunization Coverage Fact Sheet, about 19.9 million children younger than one years old did not get their DTP3 vaccines (a class of combination vaccines for a certain set of diseases) and about three fifths of them live in Afghanistan, Angola, The Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan, and South Africa (WHO 1). All these countries are 3rd world developing countries. However, the opposite goes for vaccine confidence. Based on data collected in an interview with 65819 people in 67 countries worldwide, Europe (continent) people reported having the lowest vaccine confidence in the safety of vaccines particularly France having the least confident globally. Bangladesh, Ecuador, and Iran reported highest agreement that vaccines are important. Azerbaijan, Russia, and Italy reported most skepticism towards the importance of vaccines. According to the study, education levels of individuals and countries do correlate with confidence in vaccine importance but do not affect confidence in vaccine safety (Larson 1). Such that the concept of the importance of vaccine and their safety are very different. What this all means is that vaccine confidence is much lower in countries which are already developed and have relatively high vaccine coverage. This coincides with the idea mentioned earlier that the success of vaccines in eradicating disease has partially been responsible for people to doubt their importance or effectiveness because people in underdeveloped countries are more familiar with the horrors of vaccine-preventable diseases.  </p>
</div>
    
<button class="accordion">On the effects of NME rates on disease outbreaks</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Many studies show that NME rates have a high correlation with the rate of disease outbreaks in a region. A paper published on Global Biodefense states that they found a connection between NME rates and actual vaccine coverage indicating an inverse association between them (Olive JK, et al. 1) which means a state with a greater rate of NMEs is likely to have lower vaccine coverage. Other sources such as Vox’s video “Vaccines don’t cause autism, they save lives” go on to say that regions in the United States where lots of parents don’t vaccinate also have higher rates of disease outbreak that are vaccine preventable (Vox). This data shows that NME policies and NME rates influence disease outbreak.   </p>
</div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Conclusive Piece wrapping up all the research</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Vaccine rates have dropped in many US states, vaccine confidence is lowest in 1st world countries with higher vaccine coverage, and anti-vaccination is largely accepted to be caused by human cognitive bias and media influence. The data presented by various sources shows that NME rates have risen and vaccine rates in many regions have dropped below the requirement for herd immunity. The data also points to associations between NME rates and disease outbreak in US states that allow NMEs. We’ve also seen in interviews that while 3rd world countries have less vaccine coverage, 1st world countries have lower public vaccine confidence in general pointing to the idea that the success of vaccines is paradoxically responsible for some of the skepticism surrounding it. Studies in psychology based on our previous knowledge of human behavior in other matters show that anti-vaccination is greatly driven by natural human cognitive bias which reacts with badly interpreted scientific information in the media. Overall there is a healthy amount of information and studies available about anti-vaccination but not so much in the area of statistics because we can’t easily evaluate what everyone thinks about vaccines and know how many people would get exempt from vaccination given the chance. We only have hard data from US states that allow vaccine exemption. What we can take from these studies is that anti-vaccination does have a significant effect on vaccine rates and disease outbreaks even in developed countries. </p>  <p>Some might say that anti-vaccination is not a note-worthy issue when it comes to vaccine coverage due to more significant factors at play. While there are still many logistical problems (such as financial and infrastructural problems in underdeveloped regions) involved in improving vaccine coverage, anti-vaccination still has the potential to hinder progress. Based on data presented, pushing for legislation to better enforce vaccination and remove legal loopholes which allow parents to get exemption forms is effective in reducing the negative impact of anti-vaccination on herd immunity goals. </p>
