        <button class="accordion">Introducing the anti-vaccine movement and the current state of vaccine coverage in the united states and the rest of the world. </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Over the past few years, vaccine rates have dropped in many US states and at the same time, some diseases thought to have been eradicated, such as whooping cough and the measles have seen comeback outbreaks (Matthews 1). The World Health Organization says in their vaccine fact sheet that global vaccine coverage is at 85% and hasn’t improved in several years (WHO 1). Based on this information we haven’t yet reached the global quota of vaccine coverage to maintain herd immunity. Herd immunity is the threshold of vaccine coverage needed to be maintained in order to keep disease from spreading particularly through vulnerable people such as infants, the elderly, people with diseases that disallow them from vaccinating, as well as people with very weak immune systems. When people stop vaccinating it brings down the vaccine coverage and creates weak spots where disease can take hold and spread. Many efforts are being made by several organizations including the WHO to reach a vaccine coverage goal by 2020 (WHO 1) and one of the difficulties standing in the way is a wave of misinformation that has given rise to a movement of people who deliberately choose not to vaccinate, collectively called the anti-vaccine movement or “anti-vaxxers”. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Introducing the information we have on NMEs and what they are and how they work. </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The information available about anti-vaccination is rather limited. Most of what we have is NME (non-medical exemption) rates. These NME rates are also only limited to countries and states that allow NMEs. Other data includes interviews and psychological analysis based on previous knowledge of human behavior. This paper will review various sources of data related to anti-vaccination, the psychology behind anti-vaccination, global vaccine coverage, and correlations found between NME rates and disease outbreaks. 
  
NME stands for Non-Medical Exemption, and as the name suggests, it is an exemption form a parent can fill out to be excused from vaccination for non-medical reasons. Not all regions allow NMEs and different US states may have specific laws related to vaccine exemptions. As of 2017, 3 states have fully disallowed NMEs while the others allow either only religious exemption or both religious and philosophical exemption (see Figure 1). In regard to the difference between religious and philosophical exemption, the National Conference of State Legislatures says:</p> <blockquote class="card-text blockquote text-center">

“Religious exemption indicates that there is a provision in the statute that allows parents to exempt their children from vaccination if it contradicts their sincere religious beliefs. 

 

Philosophical exemption indicates that the statutory language does not restrict the exemption to purely religious or spiritual beliefs.  For example, Maine allows restrictions based on "moral, philosophical or other personal beliefs," and Minnesota allows objections based on “conscientiously held beliefs of the parent or guardian.”” (NCSL 1) </blockquote>

    <p>So, the primary difference between religious and philosophical exemption is the language used in your reasons for the exemption. Do note that exemption for medical reasons is a completely different story. In some cases, such as a pregnancy, one can be exempt from vaccination. </p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Current state of NME policy and how NME rates have changed over the years.</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>NME rates have risen in many of the US states that allow them over the years. According to a journal published by PLOS medicine, the number of NMEs in kindergartners has increased dramatically between 2009 and 2014 in 12 of the states that allow philosophical vaccine exemption and has continued to climb to this day (see Figure 2) (Olive JK et al. 1). A report by the American Academy of Family Physicians claims that the state of Idaho, a state which allows NMEs had the most NMEs. During the evaluation, Idaho had approved 147 religious exemptions and 1295 philosophical exemptions. The academy also claims, “There are 11 states (AK, AZ, CO, ID, ME, MI, OR, UT, VT, WA, and WI) that reported 4% of its kindergarteners claimed exemptions.” (AAFP 1). The focus of many of these studies is infants and young children likely because they are the most vulnerable to contracting vaccine-preventable illnesses. </p>
