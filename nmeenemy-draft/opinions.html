        <p class="lead">Why we need to start acting now to tighten vaccine exemption policy</p> <hr>
        <p>In the publication "No More Kidding Around:
Restructuring Non-Medical Childhood
Immunization Exemptions to Ensure
Public Health Protection" by Ross D. Silverman, we get an overview of the current policies in place for vaccine exemptions. As quoted from Daniel A. Salmon, M.P.H., Johns Hopkins University School of
            Public Health' </p>  <blockquote class="card-text blockquote text-center"> "A lot of states call their exemptions religious, but anyone who wants it,
gets it."  </blockquote>. <p>The "religious" exemption being referred to here is as opposed to religious and philisophical vaccine exemption. What Dr. Salmon is saying is that while some states don't allow personal beliefs to be a reason for exemption it is not much harder to write up made-up relgious reasons for vaccine exemption because there is no practical verification in place. To get religious exemption you don't have to prove anything you just have to write down that your religion prohibits it. Many will find that the number of mainstream religions which actually prohibit vaccination are very miniscule and the majority of religious leaders don't oppose vaccination. It's not hard to see that the majority of people applying for religious vaccine exemption aren't actually getting it for religious reasons. We might as well not have a required reason for exemption at all at this stage. </p> <br> <p>Currently only 3 US states disallow non-medical exemption of vaccines. 18 states allow for both philosophical and religious exemption while the rest only allow religious exemption. The reasoning behind allowing religious or personal belief exemption from vaccines is personal freedom. In the United States we have strong values of freedom of choice built into our constitution that have carried on into our culture. These exemptions are based on the belief that vaccines are a personal choice to get a medical procedure that only affects you. It seems that it hasn't occured to many people that getting vaccinated isn't a choice that only affects the individual it's a choice that affects the lives and safety of everyone. And we can see that NMEs do have a direct impact on vaccine coverage in the study published by PLOS Medicine, "The state of the antivaccine movement in the United States". Quoted from the study:  </p> <blockquote class="card-text blockquote text-center"> We analyzed the relationship between NME rates and actual vaccine coverage, and found an inverse association between NME rate and measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage of kindergarteners in these states (P = 0.03 by Spearman correlation), indicating that states with higher overall NME rates do in fact have lower MMR vaccine coverage (P = 0.007 by beta regression). </blockquote> <p>This means that US states with higher NME rates have lower vaccine coverage. Lower vaccine coverage is a problem because it determines our herd immunity. Herd immunity is the threshold needed to be held in order to keep a disease from spreading. For example the measles virus requires a vaccine coverage of at least 95% to insure the disease doesn't get a hold on the population. Disease can still spread to vaccinated people with weaker immune systems it's not a matter of having one person vaccinated what's important is having the majority of people vaccinated so the vaccine doesn't have an easy means of finding a host and how easily a disease spreads varies. Measles and Whooping cough can spread very easily that is why we see them emerge quickly in regions with lower vaccine coverage. </p> <br> <p>What can be done about this issue? We can't just let exemption continue at this rate. We have yet to see the worst of vaccine-prevenatable disease such as polio. Many solutions come to mind such as attempting to educate and persuade anti-vaxxers but it's not as simple as educating and teaching people about vaccines. Studies have shown that education level in a country does improve people's understanding of the importance of vaccination but it does not improve people's confidence in the safety of vaccines. The issue gets even more complicated when we consider today's understanding of the cognitive biases that are behind anti-vaccination. This is explained in detail in the youtube video by SciShow called "The science of anti-vaccination". Based on this information we can conclude that it would be too costly to attempt to change people's minds about vaccines if they have been opposed to them for so long. On the other hand we have the option of tightening our exemption policies or just eradicating non-medical exemption entirely. This has been shown to be effective in states Like California. California stopped allowing vaccine exemption in 2016 after several disastrous disease outbreaks. California had previously allowed for philosophical and religious exemption and due to California's big eceonomy and metropolitan cities it lead to creating major weak spots in populated zones. We also already know that states with high NME rates have lower coverage (see above).  </p> <br> <p>Today you can start making a difference by spreading awareness of this issue. Share this website on social media and sign the petition on the home page (other instructions are there too). This will get the attention of authorities and put pressure on people in power to start moving towards stronger exemption laws. If we don't reach vaccine coverage goals soon the future may be bleak with the spread of deadly diseases.</p>
