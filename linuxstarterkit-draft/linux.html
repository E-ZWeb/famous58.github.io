            <ul>
                <li>(The Linux Foundation 2019)According to The Linux Foundation,
                    Linux is an operating system much like Windows and MacOSX.
                    <ul>
                        <li>An operating system is the software that takes care
                            of low-level hardware related tasks for you.</li>
                        <li>Linux is specifically just the kernel of the
                            operating system which handles low level hardware
                            tasks for higher level programs.</li>
                        <li>The rest of the operating system consists of much
                            smaller programs that handle specific tasks such as
                            the GNU utilities which is a collection of programs
                            typically shipped with linux which handle basic
                            tasks often taken for granted. </li>
                        <li>Coreutils info pic. </li>
                        <li>The rest of the operating system depends on the
                            distribution. <ul>
                                <li>Usually a 3rd party company or entity will
                                    package GNU/Linux with higher level software
                                    that you would normally use such as all the
                                    graphics and interfaces you see on the
                                    screen.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>(Ritchie 1984) Unix OS was developed in 1969 by Bell Labs.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unix was fully developed and written in the C
                            programming language in 1973 making it available to
                            to be ported to many different computers. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>(Raymond 2003) For legal reasons at the time AT&amp;T had to
                    share the C source code of Unix to anyone who requested it.
                    This caused it to grow quickly and get adopted by
                    educational and non-profit institutions.</li>
                <li>However eventually AT&amp;T parted ways with Bell Labs
                    allowing Bell Labs to make Unix proprietary, hiding the
                    source code.</li>
                <li>This meant it could no longer be used for educational
                    purposes as it could not be modified and studied (15)</li>
                <li>(Stallman 1983) Because of this Richard Stallman began the
                    GNU project.<ul>
                        <li>The GNU project aimed to create free and open source
                            alternatives to the Unix system. </li>
                        <li>In time the GNU project grew and consisted of a
                            large code base of robust tools and utilities needed
                            for an operating system. </li>
                        <li>However the GNU project lacked a kernel, as
                            we&#39;ve learned is the critical component needed
                            to interface with hardware. <ul>
                                <li>This is where linux came into play as it
                                    supplied the GNU project with a Kernel.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="a-new-era-of-open-source">A new Era of Open Source</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>(Torvalds 1991) In 1991 at the university of helsinki, Linus
                    torvalds began working on the Linux kernel. For a period of
                    time Linux had no good set of tools and was borrowing from
                    the MINIX project which was problematic due to software
                    Licensing. </li>
                <li>Eventually Torvalds found out about the GNU project. <ul>
                        <li>Torvalds incorporated the GNU utilities into Linux
                            and adopted the GNU General Public License (GPL).
                            Now we have (what was considered at the time) a
                            usable operating system under an open source
                            license. <h4 id="what-is-the-gpl-">What is the GPL?</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>(Stallman 2003) The GPL is a software
                                    license that is the most important part of
                                    the GNU project. </li>
                                <li>It&#39;s goal is to give the user freedom to
                                    study and modify the source code of the
                                    software while also guaranteeing any changes
                                    made to the software must be made public.
                                    This way you can&#39;t take advantage of the
                                    software without contributing back. </li>
                                <li>For more information on open source software
                                    and licensing take a look at the Open Source

            <ul>
                <li>(Garfinkel 2003) Linux began making it into the mainstream
                    when companies started taking advantage of it&#39;s open
                    source nature for their projects.<ul>
                        <li>NASA began using Linux in supercomputers as it was
                            much less expensive to have many smaller machines
                            running linux than to have a large expensive
                            enterprise machine.</li>
                        <li>Dell, IBM, and HP also began offering Linux support
                            on their consumer PCs to combat Microsoft&#39;s
                            monopoly on Desktops. </li>
