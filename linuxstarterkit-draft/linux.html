        <ul>
            <li><b class="text-warning"></b> According to The Linux Foundation,
                Linux is an operating system much like Windows and MacOSX (Linux Foundation, 2019).
                <ul>
                    <li>An operating system is the software that takes care
                        of low-level hardware related tasks for you.</li>
                    <li>Linux is specifically just the kernel of the
                        operating system which handles low level hardware
                        tasks for higher level programs.</li>
                    <li>The rest of the operating system consists of much
                        smaller programs that handle specific tasks such as
                        the GNU utilities which is a collection of programs
                        typically shipped with linux which handle basic
                        tasks often taken for granted. </li>
                    <li>Coreutils info pic. </li>
                    <li>The rest of the operating system depends on the
                        distribution. <ul>
                            <li>Usually a 3rd party company or entity will
                                package GNU/Linux with higher level software
                                that you would normally use such as all the
                                graphics and interfaces you see on the

        <h2 id="history">History</h2>
        <h3 id="prelude">Prelude</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Unix OS was developed in 1969 by Bell Labs (Ritchie, 1984).
                <ul>
                    <li>Unix was fully developed and written in the C
                        programming language in 1973 making it available to
                        to be ported to many different computers. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>For legal reasons at the time AT&amp;T had to
                share the C source code of Unix to anyone who requested it.
                This caused it to grow quickly and get adopted by
                educational and non-profit institutions.(Raymond, 2003)</li>
            <li>However eventually AT&amp;T parted ways with Bell Labs
                allowing Bell Labs to make Unix proprietary, hiding the
                source code.</li>
            <li>This meant it could no longer be used for educational
                purposes as it could not be modified and studied</li>
            <li>Because of this Richard Stallman began the
                GNU project (Stallman, 1983).<ul>
                    <li>The GNU project aimed to create free and open source
                        alternatives to the Unix system. </li>
                    <li>In time the GNU project grew and consisted of a
                        large code base of robust tools and utilities needed
                        for an operating system. </li>
                    <li>However the GNU project lacked a kernel, as
                        we&#39;ve learned is the critical component needed
                        to interface with hardware. <ul>
                            <li>This is where linux came into play as it
                                supplied the GNU project with a Kernel.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="a-new-era-of-open-source">A new Era of Open Source</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1991 at the university of helsinki, Linus
                torvalds began working on the Linux kernel. For a period of
                time Linux had no good set of tools and was borrowing from
                the MINIX project which was problematic due to software
                Licensing. (Torvalds, 1991)</li>
            <li>Eventually Torvalds found out about the GNU project. <ul>
                    <li>Torvalds incorporated the GNU utilities into Linux
                        and adopted the GNU General Public License (GPL).
                        Now we have (what was considered at the time) a
                        usable operating system under an open source
                        license. <h4 id="what-is-the-gpl-">What is the GPL?</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The GPL is a software
                                license that is the most important part of
                                the GNU project. </li>
                            <li>It&#39;s goal is to give the user freedom to
                                study and modify the source code of the
                                software while also guaranteeing any changes
                                made to the software must be made public.
                                This way you can&#39;t take advantage of the
                                software without contributing back. </li>
                            <li>For more information on open source software
                                and licensing take a look at the Open Source
                                Initiative website.(Stallman, 2003) <ul>

        <h3 id="linux-takes-off-">Linux Takes off.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux began making it into the mainstream
                when companies started taking advantage of it&#39;s open
                source nature for their projects.<ul>
                    <li>NASA began using Linux in supercomputers as it was
                        much less expensive to have many smaller machines
                        running linux than to have a large expensive
                        enterprise machine.</li>
                    <li>Dell, IBM, and HP also began offering Linux support
                        on their consumer PCs to combat Microsoft&#39;s
                        monopoly on Desktops. </li>

                                called NAOqi OS</li>
                            <li>Obviously the licensing of linux makes it
                                perfect for educational and scientific use

        <h1 id="is-linux-right-for-you-opinion-">Is Linux Right For You? (opinion)</h1>
        <p>The short answer is yes. Most people could benefit from at least trying out Linux. It&#39;s free and it&#39;s
            fun. </p>
        <p>Here is the long answer. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>You probably shouldn&#39;t try Linux if any of the following apply to you. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You don't have the time to adapt to a new workspace.<ul>
                            <li>Depending on your current level of technical skill, getting used to a new technology can take time
                                and patience. If you don't have either of those then what's the point of trying a new Operating system?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I doubt this is an issue for anyone visiting this site as visiting this site is a good sign
                                that you want to try Linux and have the time and patience to do so.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If the following applies to you, perhaps performing a full system install isn&#39;t the thing for
                    you. Instead consider installing Linux along-side windows or as a virtual machine.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>You have a job that relies on using windows or mac and your home PC is your job PC. (If it is
                            a sensitive job I recommend installing Linux on a seperate machine or a seperate hard disk.)

                    <li>
                        <p>More than half your most played games have no Linux support.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>consider that if you no longer play a game why worry about Linux support? There are over
                                3000 steam games on Linux now, many of which are AAA games.</li>
                            <li>Not to mention with Proton on Steam you can now play thousands of Windows only games on
                                Linux with the click of a button.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        <p>You use major software that only runs on windows. (Photoshop, Autodesk, After Effects etc.)

                <p>If the following all apply to you, then you should probably try Linux if not completely switch over
                    to it. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You don&#39;t rely on software that doesn&#39;t have Linux support</li>
                    <li>You don&#39;t have any hardware that only supports windows.</li>
                    <li>Your GPU has good drivers on Linux.</li>
                    <li>Second list of criteria doesn&#39;t apply to you .</li>
                    <li>You&#39;re not a hardcore gamer.</li>
                    <li>You&#39;re getting tired of windows and want to try something new. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>So in general there aren&#39;t a lot of reasons to not try Linux. The fact that you&#39;ve made it to the
            website probably means you have a reason to try it so why not head over to <a href="./distros.html">the distros page</a>
        to get started with a Linux distribution.</p>
