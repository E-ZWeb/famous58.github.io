            <h3 id="what" class="text-primary"> What is a Linux distribution?
            </h3>
            <p class="lead ml-5">To be clear, "distro" is just short for
                "distribution".
            </p>
            <p class="lead ml-5"><small class="text-warning">(Hoffman 2016)</small>
                In short a distribution is just a
                variation of linux configured and implemented
                differently. (4)
            </p>
            <p class="lead ml-5"><small class="text-warning">(Hoffman 2016)</small>There
                are many many linux distros out there.
                Thousands of linux distributions have been
                developed by corporations, governments, non-profits, and
                hobbyists to fill specific niches (4). To illustrate this here
                is <a

                the
                periodic table is actually a simplified and slimmed down picture
                of Linux distros. For a full family tree
                of linux distributions see

                primary difference between linux distributions is
                often how the user interacts with the system (8).
                To demonstrate, (Figure 2) below we have Ubuntu 18.04 (left) and
                OpenSUSE Tumbleweed (right). You can use the
                slider at the bottom to compare how their interfaces differ.

                Canonical Ltd. and SUSE respectively. They take very different
                approaches to the user interface.<small class="text-warning">(Jasuja,
                    Gauri, Techboy317 2019) </small>While both
                interfaces include most of the same features functionally,
                OpenSUSE uses the <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a>
                interface, which according to diffen.com, follows a similar
                format of the Windows UI while Ubuntu uses the
                <a href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> interface which has
                it's own philosophy and design for graphical user interfaces.

            <h3 id="does" class="text-primary">Does it matter which distro I

            <p class="lead ml-5">
                Based on my experience it doesn't matter what your first Linux distribution
                is as long as it's user-friendly. <a href="#list"> Below</a> is
                a
                list of distros that are safe for new users and a list of
                distros that new users should avoid. This list is
                based on my personal experience with Linux and hearing the
                stories of new users. However do note that there are a lot of
                distributions with a niche use case
                that you might like to use which I do not list. If you are
                interested in finding something specific for your use
                case such as a scientific Linux distro take a look at <a
                    href="https://distrochooser.de/en">distrochooser</a>,
                a website with a quiz which finds a distro that matches your use
                case.
