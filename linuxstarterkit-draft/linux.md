# Linux

## What is Linux?

- (The Linux Foundation)According to The Linux Foundation, Linux is an operating system much like Windows and MacOSX. 
  - An operating system is the software that takes care of low-level hardware related tasks for you.
  - Linux is specifically just the kernel of the operating system which handles low level hardware tasks for higher level programs.
  - The rest of the operating system consists of much smaller programs that handle specific tasks such as the GNU utilities which is a collection of programs typically shipped with Linux which handle basic tasks often taken for granted.

  - The rest of the operating system depends on the distribution. 
    - Usually a 3rd party company or entity will package GNU/Linux with higher level software that you would normally use such as all the graphics and interfaces you see on the screen.

## History

### Prelude
- (Ritchie 1984) Unix OS was developed in 1969 by Bell Labs. 
  - Unix was fully developed and written in the C programming language in 1973 making it available to to be ported to many different computers. 
- (Raymond 2003) For legal reasons at the time AT&T had to share the C source code of Unix to anyone who requested it. This caused it to grow quickly and get adopted by educational and non-profit institutions.
- However eventually AT&T parted ways with Bell Labs allowing Bell Labs to make Unix proprietary, hiding the source code.
- This meant it could no longer be used for educational purposes as it could not be modified and studied (15)
- (Stallman 1983) Because of this Richard Stallman began the GNU project.
  - The GNU project aimed to create free and open source alternatives to the Unix system. 
  - In time the GNU project grew and consisted of a large code base of robust tools and utilities needed for an operating system. 
  - However the GNU project lacked a kernel, as we've learned is the critical component needed to interface with hardware. 
    - This is where Linux came into play as it supplied the GNU project with a Kernel. 

### A new Era of Open Source 

- (Torvalds 1991) In 1991 at the university of helsinki, Linus torvalds began working on the Linux kernel. For a period of time Linux had no good set of tools and was borrowing from the MINIX project which was problematic due to software Licensing. 
- Eventually Torvalds found out about the GNU project. 
  - Torvalds incorporated the GNU utilities into Linux and adopted the GNU General Public License (GPL). Now we have (what was considered at the time) a usable operating system under an open source license. 
#### What is the GPL?
    - (Stallman 2003) The GPL is a software license that is the most important part of the GNU project. 
    - It's goal is to give the user freedom to study and modify the source code of the software while also guaranteeing any changes made to the software must be made public. This way you can't take advantage of the software without contributing back. 
    - For more information on open source software and licensing take a look at the Open Source Initiative website. 
      - https://opensource.org/

### Linux Takes off. 

- (Garfinkel 2003) Linux began making it into the mainstream when companies started taking advantage of it's open source nature for their projects.
  - NASA began using Linux in supercomputers as it was much less expensive to have many smaller machines running Linux than to have a large expensive enterprise machine.
  - Dell, IBM, and HP also began offering Linux support on their consumer PCs to combat Microsoft's monopoly on Desktops. 

### Today

- Today Linux is used everywhere in technology often in places people don't think about. 
  - Web servers
    - This website and millions of others are running Linux web servers. 
  - Android Phones
    - One of the most recent rises in Linux is android phones which are all running on top of Linux. 
  - Supercomputers
  - Robots
    - As an example, the well known advanced Nao robots used in education run a GNU/Linux OS called NAOqi OS
    - Obviously the licensing of Linux makes it perfect for educational and scientific use cases.
  - Desktops
    - (Logba 2019) Linux has a very small market share on the Desktop currently at around 3.37%.
      - Microsoft Windows is the dominant Desktop OS still but Linux is gaining some traction recently for reasons not quite known. Possibly many factors involved.

- Linux is trusted and used by many corporations including Microsoft, often thought of as a rival of Linux. 
- (MICROSOFT WINDOWS SERVER TEAM
 2015) Microsoft like many companies embraces Linux and open source as it is a crucial part of their infrastructure. 


# Is Linux Right For You? (opinion)

The short answer is yes. Most people could benefit from at least trying out Linux. It's free and it's fun. 

Here is the long answer. 

- You probably shouldn't try Linux if any of the following apply to you. 
  - You are impatient and dislike trying/learning new things.
    - that's it. That's the only viable reason not to try Linux. 
    - I don't think a lot of people fall in this category. 

- If the following applies to you, perhaps performing a full system install isn't the thing for you. Instead consider installing Linux along-side windows or as a virtual machine.

  - You have a job that relies on using windows or mac and your home PC is your job PC. (If it is a sensitive job I recommend installing Linux on a seperate machine or a seperate hard disk.)

  - More than half your most played games have no Linux support.
    - consider that if you no longer play a game why worry about Linux support? There are over 3000 steam games on Linux now, many of which are AAA games.
    - Not to mention with Proton on Steam you can now play thousands of Windows only games on Linux with the click of a button.

  - You use major software that only runs on windows. (Photoshop, Autodesk, After Effects etc.)

  - You use some sort of hardware or accessory that doesn't have Linux support yet (see Drivers page)

  - You use apple products.
    - You can usually install Linux on an Apple Mac product but it's often a hassle and I do not recommend it.
  - Links to learn about installing Linux alongside windows or in a VM
    - Dual Booting

    - Virtual Machines
      - https://blog.storagecraft.com/the-dead-simple-guide-to-installing-a-linux-virtual-machine-on-windows/

- If the following all apply to you, then you should probably try Linux if not completely switch over to it. 

  1. You don't rely on software that doesn't have Linux support
  2. You don't have any hardware that only supports windows.
  3. Your GPU has good drivers on Linux.
  4. Second list of criteria doesn't apply to you .
  5. You're not a hardcore gamer.
  6. You're getting tired of windows and want to try something new. 

So in general there aren't a lot of reasons to not try Linux. The fact that you've made it to the website probably means you have a reason to try it.
